# change image names

Python script to change image names form the command line fast

usage: change_file_names.py directory_where_images_are name_files_to

ex. change_file_names.py /desktop/images new_image_name


More Info:

This file will take the directory and the names of the files you want.
It renames all image files currently

so if you just downloaded a bunch of pics from your vacation in Ohio, where all people go, you can take those cryptic jpg and png files and just rename them fast to something more meaningful.

so a bunch of files like "IMG_0136.jpg" become "Ohio Trip 0001.jpg"

nothing fancy yet, simple utility.

More to come.
